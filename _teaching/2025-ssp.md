I served as a Teaching Assistant and Residential Mentor for the inaugural Summer Science Program in Astrophysics cohort at Colby College. The program brings 36 talented rising high school seniors (or international equivalents) to a 5-week program, where intensive instructions in mathematics, physics, and astronomy amalgamate with regular observation of near-earth asteroids, along with computational applications that culminate in an orbit report. For more information, see the (SSP site)[https://ssp.org/astrophysics/].
