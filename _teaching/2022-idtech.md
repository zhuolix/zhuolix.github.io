I served as an online coach for a variety of mathematics and computer science subjects via iD Tech's platform. In each session, I spend 1 hour with the student, for whom I provide customized instructions based on the student's age and current standing on the topic. Perhaps the most interesting part of the opportunity is the ability to teach Kerbal Space Program, a game I have long enjoyed, to students.
