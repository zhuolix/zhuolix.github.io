I am Zhuoli Xie, a recent graduate of UT Austin and a Production Engineer at Meta's Enterprise Infrastructure and Security organization.

A Chronological Brief
======
I am a native of Guangzhou, China, and a proud former student of the Affiliated High School of Guangzhou University, where I first pursued competitive programming. I technically began programming competitively in hopes of earning admission to Guangzhou No. 2 H.S.'s "Rocket Class", but life found another way - and given that No. 2 H.S. organized their contests with Pascal, perhaps life found a good way around that.

I followed my parents to the U.S. after 8th grade, first attending public high school, then going to Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science. A pioneer of state-supported "talented and gifted" (Do I fit that bill? I am skeptical, but my peers there sure are) programs, it doubles as a college under the University of North Texas, a senior high school, ~~and a curve wrecker anywhere TAMS students find themselves in UNT classes~~. This is where I began exploring academic applications of computer science, especially natural language processing - and where a lot of my research work has come from; nevertheless, I still helped run the [Computer Science Organization](https://cso.tams.club/), serving as the competitions director.

I then attended the University of Texas at Austin, where I pivoted to explore more hands-on work with software engineering, finding myself with the [Texas Product Engineering Organization](https://txproduct.org), and built the skills that got me to where I am today. See the "Resume" section for a summary of my professional experiences.

Teaching
======
One of the most valuable things I did over my education journey is teaching. I strongly believe in paying forward - to that end, I find teaching to be not only an effective way to train my communication skills and strengthen my own understanding of the subject matter, but also a way to help foster new generations of talent in topics of my passion.Check out the "Teaching" tab for more information.

Personal
======
I enjoy traveling - both for the scenery, and for the travel experience itself. I maintain my [FlightRadar24 profile](https://my.flightradar24.com/B_1168), and try to explore new places when feasible. I especially enjoy transit-accessible natural hikes - whether that's Pelham Bay Park or San Bruno Mountain.
